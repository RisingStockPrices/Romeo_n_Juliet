Press 1 to add your input polygon file and 2 to test your polygon.

## 1: Adding Input Polygon Mode
Click to add vertices in your polygon.
Make sure there are no LOOPS!
If you made a mistake, press the left arrow key to delete the most recently added vertex.
If you wish to start over again, press the lower arrow key to delete the vertices added so far.

Once you are done, press the upper arrow key to save your polygon. 
This will end the program and save your polygon as file named "new_input_please_save_separately.txt" in the inputs folder of the Project.
In order to test your polygon, you must rename the file with the form "inputNN.txt". An integer number should take place in the NN part.
example) "input32.txt", "input2.txt" (o), "input_2.txt"(x)


## 2: Testing Polygon Mode
Type in an integer number corresponding to the input file you wish to test out. 
If you would like to test out the file "input53.txt", then type in '53' and press enter.
Once the polygon appears, click to add test points.
Once you've chosen two points, the shortest path will appear in bright green lines.
If you wish to test again, press the space bar to delete the current test points and you can start over again.
